Working on the three layout types we are asked to do, it took me around 3 hours. This includes 
the time spent revising class slides and reference reading. Special I was confused about grid
at first so I spent some time to read more. 

For the float design one of the issue I was having was placing the border between menu items.
Putting the border property to solid did not crossed my mind at first. But, I figured it out 
after a while.

For flex layout it took me a while to figure out that I have to use flex-wrap to see the responsive 
effect. 

Grid layout took me a considerable amount of time. At first the grid-template-areas: property was not 
working for me as expected until i figured out that it should be applied to the immediate parent 
rather than far more ancestor of an element. This was the case while working of the columns where I 
tried the template areas form the body layout rather than their container.
